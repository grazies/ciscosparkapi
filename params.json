They are *RESTful*,  *naturally structured*, require only a *simple Access Token for authentication*, and *the data is elegantly represented in intuitive JSON*.  What could be easier?\r\n\r\n.. code-block:: python\r\n\r\n    import requests\r\n\r\n    URL = 'https://api.ciscospark.com/v1/messages'\r\n    ACCESS_TOKEN = '<your_access_token>'\r\n    ROOM_ID = '<room_id>'\r\n    MESSAGE_TEXT = '<message_text>'\r\n\r\n    headers = {'Authorization': 'Bearer ' + ACCESS_TOKEN,\r\n               'Content-type': 'application/json;charset=utf-8'}\r\n    post_data = {'roomId': ROOM_ID,\r\n                 'text': MESSAGE_TEXT}\r\n    response = requests.post(URL, json=post_data, headers=headers)\r\n    if response.status_code == 200:\r\n        # Great your message was posted!\r\n        message_id = response.json['id']\r\n        message_text = response.json['id']\r\n        print(\"New message created, with ID:\", message_id)\r\n        print(message_text)\r\n    else:\r\n        # Oops something went wrong...  Better do something about it.\r\n        print(response.status_code, response.text)\r\n\r\nLike I said, *EASY*.  However, in use, the code can be rather repetitive...\r\n\r\n- You have to setup the environment every time\r\n- You have to remember URLs and request arguments (or reference the docs)\r\n- You have to parse the returned JSON and setup variables to hold the attributes you need\r\n- When requesting lists of items, you have to deal with pagination_\r\n\r\n\r\nEnter **ciscosparkapi**, a simple API wrapper that wraps all of the Spark API calls and returned JSON objects within native Python objects and function calls.\r\n\r\nWith ciscosparkapi, the above Python code can be consolidated to the following:\r\n\r\n.. code-block:: python\r\n\r\n    from ciscosparkapi import CiscoSparkAPI\r\n\r\n    api = CiscoSparkAPI()\r\n    try:\r\n        message = api.messages.create('<room_id>', text='<message_text>')\r\n        print(\"New message created, with ID:\", message.id)\r\n        print(message.text)\r\n    except SparkApiError as e:\r\n        print(e)\r\n\r\nThe ciscosparkapi package handles all of this for you:\r\n\r\n+ Reads your Spark access token from a ``SPARK_ACCESS_TOKEN`` environment variable\r\n+ Wraps and represents all Spark API calls as a simple hierarchical tree of native-Python methods (with default arguments provided everywhere possible!)\r\n+ If your Python IDE supports **auto-completion** (like PyCharm_), you can navigate the available methods and object attributes right within your IDE\r\n+ Represents all returned JSON objects as native Python objects - you can access all of the object's attributes using native *dot.syntax*\r\n+ **Automatic and Transparent Pagination!**  When requesting 'lists of objects' from Spark, requests for additional pages of responses are efficiently and automatically requested as needed\r\n+ Multipart encoding and uploading of local files, when creating messages with local file attachments\r\n\r\nAll of this, combined, lets you do powerful things simply:\r\n\r\n.. code-block:: python\r\n\r\n    from ciscosparkapi import CiscoSparkAPI\r\n\r\n    api = CiscoSparkAPI()\r\n\r\n    # Find all rooms that have 'ciscosparkapi Demo' in their title\r\n    all_rooms = api.rooms.list()\r\n    demo_rooms = [room for room in all_rooms if 'ciscosparkapi Demo' in room.title]\r\n\r\n    # Delete all of the demo rooms\r\n    for room in demo_rooms:\r\n        api.rooms.delete(room.id)\r\n\r\n    # Create a new demo room\r\n    demo_room = api.rooms.create('ciscosparkapi Demo')\r\n\r\n    # Add people to the new demo room\r\n    email_addresses = [\"test01@cmlccie.com\", \"test02@cmlccie.com\"]\r\n    for email in email_addresses:\r\n        api.memberships.create(demo_room.id, personEmail=email)\r\n\r\n    # Post a message to the new room, and upload a file\r\n    api.message.create(demo_room.id, text=\"Welcome to the room!\", files=[\"welcome.jpg\"])\r\n\r\nThat's more than six Spark API calls in less than 23 lines of script code (with comments)!\r\n...and likely more than that depending on how many rooms are returned by Spark (remember pagination is handled for you automatically)\r\n\r\n\r\nInstallation\r\n------------\r\n\r\nInstallation and updating of ciscosparkapi is easy:\r\n\r\n**Install via PIP**\r\n\r\n.. code-block:: bash\r\n\r\n    $ pip install ciscosparkapi\r\n\r\n**Upgrading to the latest Version**\r\n\r\n.. code-block:: bash\r\n\r\n    $ pip install ciscosparkapi --upgrade\r\n\r\n\r\nReleases & Release Notes\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nComplete and usable *Beta* releases_ have been published for this package.\r\n\r\nWhile the package APIs may change (while the package is in beta), the package capabilities should all be functional.
